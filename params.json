Use the button to set it to your current selection.\r\n2. **Destination Container** -- The container that you want your items to go into when sorting them (Can be your Character, a Backpack, an Opened Chest, or Another Player). Use the button to set it to your current selection.\r\n3. **Insert Position** -- The `Slot ID` to start inserting at in the `Destination Container` (Default = 0)\r\n4. **Sort String** -- The String to use when Sorting. Can be typed in manually or build on the `Build` tab\r\n5. **Object Class Filter** -- Use this to only sort a particular type of item, like Armor/Notes/Gems/Salvage/etc\r\n6. **Progress Bar** -- Items need to be identified before they are sorted, this progress bar tracks the identifying and sorting\r\n7. **Activate Button** -- Begins the sorting process, or cancels it if it's already running.\r\n\r\n###Build Tab\r\n\r\n![plugin-build-screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mudzereli/mudsort/master/docs/assets/plugin-build.png \"Build Tab Screenshot\")\r\n\r\n1. **Sort List Filter** -- Filter Sort Flags by type (Commonly Used/Word/Number/etc)\r\n2. **Added Sort Flags** -- Sort Flags that will be used to create the current Sort String in the Sort tab\r\n3. **Remaining Sort Flags** -- The additional Sort Flags in the filtered list that can be added to Sort by\r\n\r\n###Options Tab\r\n\r\n![plugin-options-screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mudzereli/mudsort/master/docs/assets/plugin-options.png \"Options Tab Screenshot\")\r\n\r\n1. **Identify Inventory On Login** -- If checked, your inventory will be queued up for ID when you log in, so that when you go to sort them later, you won't have to wait for them to identify.\r\n2. **Reverse Sort List** -- This reverses the sorting string completely\r\n3. **Property Dump Selection** -- Select an item and then click this to view ALL of its properties\r\n4. **Saved Sort Strings** -- Use this area to save your favorite Sort Strings (fancy I know)\r\n5. **Save** -- Save all settings and Sort Strings","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
